## Rethinking the Web

The Web has become an integral part of our daily lives. We communicate, learn, entertain, and even exist through it. As the Web continues to evolve, there is a pervasive belief that expanding its role will inevitably make our world better.

The Atman Project arises from this question: Do we really need the Web to expand in its current direction? Expanding the Web isn’t without cost. The common misconception is that the Web is free because many services require no direct payment. However, nothing in our world is truly free. We implicitly trade our data, privacy, and time for the convenience the Web offers.

While I wouldn’t say the Web is corrupted, it has certainly become intrusive. Companies that sustain the Web with their profit-driven models are compelled to expand it, making it larger and more complex to accommodate increasing users, traffic, and multifaceted use cases. This growth consumes vast amounts of human energy, natural resources, and time. They continue to generate revenue under the guise of making the world a better place, but we must critically assess whether these efforts are truly necessary.

The Web doesn’t have to be this way. It can be simple. It can resemble the physical world we inhabit — a world where we aren’t overwhelmed with excessive information and stimuli. Imagine a Web where we only interact with those we wish to engage with, and where we access information that is truly relevant and manageable. This would be sufficient because that is how we live in the real world.

Of course, the Web and the Internet should continue to serve as vast reservoirs of knowledge that enrich our lives. But they should not delude us into thinking we can become superhuman, capable of accomplishing anything effortlessly and without cost. The Web shouldn’t be bloated to perpetuate this illusion faster and to more people.

We have the potential to build a minimal yet optimal Web—one that respects our privacy and time. In this vision, the Web would offer greater power and utility, but only when we consciously choose to contribute our fair share. This change would reorient us towards recognizing and valuing the real world, rather than becoming lost in an intrusive digital one. It would reduce the environmental toll we justify in the name of progress. Ultimately, this approach would help us focus on caring for ourselves and our tangible communities, rather than investing in the lives of strangers online.

## Objective

Atman Project hopes that Internet users can easily control who can access to their data.

Users should be able to continuously track and control access to all the data I shared or published through the internet. This capability should not be dependent on specific service providers, applications, or platforms. Regardless of which storage, application, or vendor I use to publish my data, that data should be entirely under my control (or someone authorized by me). The current architecture of the Web may not be well-suited for this goal. The Atman Project is focused on designing and implementing the essential, feasible protocols to achieve this objective.
