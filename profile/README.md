# Atman Project

In 2023, everyone uses the Web every day for almost everything. We talk, learn, enjoy, and live on the Web these days. In addition, we tend to expand the role of the Web more and more with an assumption that the Web will make our world better. 

Atman Project starts from a doubt about this assumption. We may actually not need the Web that does everything for us. We have been living in a world that is visible, physical, and real. This will remain the same in the future. Also, the Web is not for free. The common misunderstanding that many people have is that the Web is free because we do not pay fees explicitly for most of the services on the Web. However, nothing is free in our world. We implicitly pay something to the service providers, such as our data, privacy, and time. 

I can't say that the current Web is corrupted, but today's Web is intrusive. Companies who maintain the Web with the business model mentioned above must inevitably make the Web bigger and more complex to handle more users, traffic, and complicated use cases. These developments consume tons of energy from humans, nature, and time. These are the ways they keep making revenue with a sweet sentence that they are making the world a better place. But, we must rethink whether these efforts are really necessary for us.

The Web can be simple. The Web can be like the physical world where we live. The Web doesn't need to inundate us with more information and stimuli than we can handle. We want to talk with someone I want to speak with in the real world. We want to obtain information that we really need and can handle. That is enough because that is how humans live on the Earth. 

Of course, the Web and the Internet must be maintained as the sea of information that enriches our life but shouldn't give us an illusion that we can be supermans who can do anything that we cannot do in the real world easily without paying anything. The Web shouldn't be bloated to provide this illusion with more people faster. 

We can build a minimal but optimal Web that doesn't require our privacy and time. Instead, we should be able to get more power from the Web only after we pay our fair share. This change will help us recognize our real world, not the intrusive Web. This will stop us from consuming nature with the excuse that we are developing the world. Ultimately, this will help us take care of ourselves, not people on the Web whom we don't know.
