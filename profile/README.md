# Atman Project

In 2023, everyone uses the Web every day for almost everything. We talk, learn, enjoy, and live on the Web these days. In addition, we tend to expand the role of the Web more and more with an assumption that the Web will make our world better. 

Atman Project starts from a doubt about this assumption. We may actually not need the Web that does everything for us. We have been living in a world that is visible, physical, and real. This will remain the same in the future. Also, the Web is not for free. The common misunderstanding that many people have is that the Web is free because we do not pay fees explicitly for most of the services on the Web. However, nothing is free in our world. We implicitly pay something to the service providers, such as our data, privacy, and time. 

I can't say that the current Web is corrupted, but today's Web is intrusive. Companies who maintain the Web with the business model mentioned above must inevitably make the Web bigger and more complex to handle more users, traffic, and complicated use cases. These developments consume tons of energy from humans, nature, and time. These are the ways they keep making revenue with a sweet sentence that they are making the world a better place. But, we must rethink whether these efforts are really necessary for us.

The Web can be simple. The Web can be like the physical world where we live. The Web doesn't need to inundate us with more information and stimuli than we can handle. We want to talk with someone whom I want to speak with in the real world. We want to obtain information that we really need and can handle. That would be enough because that is how human lives on the Earth. 

Of course, the Web and the Internet must be maintained as the sea of information that enriches our life, but shouldn't give us an illusion that we can be supermans who can do anything that we cannot do in the real world easily without paying anything. The Web shouldn't be bloated to provide this illusion with more people faster. 

We can build a minimal but optimal Web that doesn't require our privacy and time. Instead, we should be able to get more power from the Web only after we pay our fair share. This change will help us recognize our real world, not the intrusive Web. This will stop us from consuming nature with the excuse that we are developing the world. Ultimately, this will help us taking care of ourselves, not people on the Web whom we don't know.

## Protocols

Atman Project consists of several protocols. Each protocol targets its unique goals, but all ultimately pursue the same values.

### Universal Personal Data Sync/Backup

Universal data sync is one of the core protocols. Atman Project aims to define the universal data representations, so any end-user services built on top of Atman Project can serve the same quality of data privacy, security, and soundness.
As the first piece of Atman Project, the universal data sync protocol defines a core personal data availability layer for users to maintain their data on their own and publish it through multiple applications that they really want to use, in the secure and sustainable way.

Similar as iCloud, but without any centralized authority. Users should be able to have the seamless experience between their multiple devices without storing their personal data in the cloud storage that a centralized authority manages its funtionalities, policies, and costs, even if the authority guarantees that user data is always stored securely. This is the essential part of the permanent web for users, which can be sustained even if big tech companies stop their business someday. 

End-user decentralized applications should be able to sync user's personal data between the user's devices seemlessly. This data sync/backup can be done with peer-to-peer networking. Users should be able to choose to run their own node if they want. Or, they should be able to use nodes operated by others without comprimising privacy, but with paying compensations to them. 

Data should be basically stored in user's personal devices, even if data is delivered by decentralized peer-to-peer network through some of nodes operated by others, especially when user's devices are not reachable directly from the Internet.

### Universal Verifiable Personal Data Sharing

Similar as the `Share` button in iOS or Android mobile devices, but with the explicitly-managed data sharing history. This can be done by cryptographic signatures/encryption, zero-knowledge proof, and decentralized ledgers. Data shared on the Internet should be shaped by standard data sharing protocols, so that anyone can keep track of the history - who created the data initially and whom the data has been shared with. Also, this cryptographic history should be able to be used to detect and punish any malicious behaviour on the data.

### Personal Data Publishing 

Various Web3 infrastructures and frameworks enable users publish their data to the public Web without relying on centralized authorities. But still, it is not easy for end-users and even for application developers to shape their architecture to work with decentralized infrastructures. Atman Project should be able to fill in missing parts between applications in production and decentralized infrastructures, so that users can publish their posts, images, and videos, as if they have done in the traditional web.

### Mobile connectivity

The great advantage of decentralized peer-to-peer network is enabling mobile devices work as indenpendant decentralized nodes. Also, even a small laptop in home network can act as a decentralized node. However, there are still many challenging areas that need to be improved for better availability and performance. This is the fundamental part for all products introduced above. Atman Project is going to collaborate with many players who are crafting decentralized network infrastructure, and contribute to them in order to boosting the future of decentralized web.
